# FlashCards
### Solo Project
## Abstract
Have you ever found yourself needing just a couple moments more to practice or study? With this simple console flashcards game, you can quickly review Iterator methods and related topics before your next Mod 2 quiz!
In this Mod 2 solo project, we were asked to write a program to simulate a deck of flash cards through the command line ONLY. A user should be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score.</br>

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript, ES6 classes, TDD, Mocha, Chai
## Project Goals / Wins / And Future Features
- Feeling more comfortable with ES6, testing suites, class to class interaction, and importing and exporting files.
- I was able to get the extension of utilizing the [GitHub projects feature](https://github.com/users/KarimAl-Rashdan/projects/2). I was excited by the opportunity to improve my workflow and project planning skills. I learned through this process how to open new issues, track the status of my iterations, and keep a log of my process for each piece of functionality.
- With more time, I would like to have tested my methods in my Game.js using my sample-data file.
